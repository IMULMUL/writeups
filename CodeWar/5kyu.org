** Directions Reduction

A basic reduction with convergence testing to determine further recursion:

#+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
let rec reduceDir (ls: string list): string list = 
  let rec help ls =
    match ls with
    | [] -> []
    | "NORTH" :: "SOUTH" :: tl 
    | "SOUTH" :: "NORTH" :: tl 
    | "WEST" :: "EAST" :: tl
    | "EAST" :: "WEST" :: tl
    -> help tl
    | hd :: tl -> hd :: help tl
  in
  let res1 = help ls in
  let res2 = help res1 in
  if List.length res1 = List.length res2
  then
    res2
  else
    reduceDir res2
#+END_SRC

** Product of consecutive Fib numbers

Trivial:

#+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
let product_fib (prod: int): int * int * int =
  let rec fib n1 n2 = 
    let res = n1 * n2 in
    if res > prod
    then
      (n1, n2, 0)
    else if res = prod
    then
      (n1, n2, 1)
    else
      fib n2 (n1 + n2)
  in 
  fib 0 1
;;
#+END_SRC

** Integers: Recreation One

It could be shorter:

#+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
let list_squared (m: int) (n: int): string =
  (* your code *)
  let satisfy n' =
    let sum = ref 0 in
    let sqrti num = float_of_int num |> sqrt |> int_of_float in
    for i = 1 to n' do
      if n' mod i = 0
      then
          sum := !sum + i * i
    done;
    let r1 = sqrti !sum in
    let r2 = float_of_int !sum |> sqrt in
    if (float_of_int r1) <> r2 then -1 else !sum
  in    
  List.init (n - m) (fun i -> 
      let n = i + m in
      let res = satisfy n in
      if res <> -1 then
        "(" ^ string_of_int n ^ ", " ^ string_of_int res ^ ")"
      else
        ""
  )
  |> List.filter (fun s -> s <> "")
  |> String.concat "; "
;;
#+END_SRC
